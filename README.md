# CNN_image_classifier

This is a Convolutional neural network model with two convolution layers, for MNIST dataset to predict the handwritten letters. You can find the mnist dataset on Kaggle website.
This model uses a two convolution layer neural network with the relu function as the activation function to make predictions, and its accuracy is approximately 98% at the moment.

# CNN_image_classifier


This is Convolutional neural network model containig two convolution layer and the activation functions is relu for MNIST dataset to predict the handwritten letters. You can find the mnist dataset on Kaggle website.
This model uses a single hidden layer neural network to make predictions, and its accuracy is approximately 92% at the moment.
=======
This is a neural network model to classify the mnist dataset images.
